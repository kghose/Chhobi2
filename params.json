Several powerful commandline tools like exiftool, mdfind and convert already exist to manipulate images and image metadata. So I harked back to my Unix days and thought, why not go retro? Why not go back to the GUI as a wrapper around powerful and fast commandline tools? The use of an actual command line to perform all the actions was, of course, not strictly necessary, but if you are going retro, why not go all the way?\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nChhobi is made available for download in the hope that it may be of some use.
