{"name":"Chhobi2","tagline":"Because photographers can be geeks too","body":"A Minimal Photo Organizer for Mac.\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nChhobi is a minimal photo organizer for Mac that uses a pseudo command line interface. Chhobi allows you to browse through your photos on disk and see their metadata. You can search for photos by any metadata that Mac OS X spotlight catalogs. You can add/modify captions and keywords on photos and select photos for batch resizing.\r\n\r\nChhobi = [Python] + [Tkinter] + [exiftool][exiftool] + [mdfind][mdfind] + [PIL][pil]\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Python]: http://python.org\r\n[Tkinter]: http://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html\r\n[exiftool]: http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/exiftool_pod.html\r\n[mdfind]: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/mdfind.1.html\r\n[pil]: http://effbot.org/zone/pil-index.htm\r\n\r\nThe user manual is accessed by running the program with the -h option\r\n\r\ni.e. python guichhobi.py -h\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n=========\r\nI think iPhoto is bloated and any photo organizer concept I could come up with seemed to unnecessarily duplicate many standard OS functions, such as file organization and metadata searching. Several powerful commandline tools like exiftool, mdfind and convert already exist to manipulate images and image metadata. So I harked back to my Unix days and thought, why not go retro? Why not go back to the GUI as a wrapper around powerful and fast commandline tools? The use of an actual command line to perform all the actions was, of course, not strictly necessary, but if you are going retro, why not go all the way?\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n* Simple file browser to flip through images\r\n* Displays basic EXIF information\r\n* Displays embedded thumbnail (or generates one on the fly)\r\n* Allows you to modify captions and keywords only\r\n* Powerful searching via Mac OS X spotlight\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nChhobi is made available for download in the hope that the programs may be of some use. No claim is made that the code works and is free of bugs, but I would appreciate bug reports (kaushik.ghose@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
