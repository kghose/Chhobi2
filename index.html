        <p>Minimal Photo Organizer for Mac. Because photographers can be geeks too.</p>

<p>Chhobi is a pseudo commandline photo organizer for Mac. It allows you to browse your photos and view/change the metadata using just the keyboard. It allows you to search for photos using any metadata that Mac OS indexes.</p>

<p>Chhobi is fashioned after the Unix/Linux GUIs of old that were simply wrappers around powerful commandline tools. The GUI is created using Tkinter, <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/%7Ephil/exiftool/exiftool_pod.html">exiftool</a> is the backend that reads/writes metadata and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/mdfind.1.html">mdfind</a> performs the searches.</p>

<p>The user manual is accessed by running the program with the -h option</p>

<p>i.e. python guichhobi.py -h</p>

<a name="rationale" class="anchor" href="#rationale"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rationale</h1>

<p>I think iPhoto is bloated and any photo organizer concept I could come up with seemed to unnecessarily duplicate many standard OS functions, such as file organization and metadata searching. Several powerful commandline tools like exiftool, mdfind and convert already exist to manipulate images and image metadata. So I harked back to my Unix days and thought, why not go retro? Why not go back to the GUI as a wrapper around powerful and fast commandline tools? The use of an actual command line to perform all the actions was, of course, not strictly necessary, but if you are going retro, why not go all the way?</p>

<p>Chhobi is made available for download in the hope that the programs may be of some use. No claim is made that the code works and is free of bugs, but I would appreciate bug reports (<a href="mailto:kaushik.ghose@gmail.com">kaushik.ghose@gmail.com</a>)</p>
